<h1>Meet the Team</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div class="meet-the-team">
    <p>Willow and Sage Farms is a tiny home based sourdough bakery with a whole lot of love behind it. We keep things small, fresh, and personal and every loaf comes straight from our kitchen to your table.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="margin: 0;">Farmer Megan Lund</h2>
    <br>
    <img width= "200px" height= "200px" style="border-radius: 1rem;" src="/images/meet-the-team/megan.jpg" alt="Portrait of Farmer Megan Lund"></img>
    <p>
    <span style= "font-size: 1.5rem;"> Megan is the baker. </span> <br>
    She mixes, shapes, and bakes every loaf, cookie, cracker, and bagel that we sell.<br>
    She handles recipe testing, weekly production, packaging, and all the little details that make each market morning run smoothly.<br>
    <br>
    <i> If it comes out of the oven, Megan made it! </i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Farmer Dave Lund</h2>
    <br>
    <img width= "200px" height= "200px" style="border-radius: 1rem;" src="/images/meet-the-team/farmerdave.jpg" alt="Portrait of Farmer Dave Lund"></img>
    <p>
    <span style= "font-size: 1.5rem;"> Dave is the delivery guy, market support and master berry masher. </span> <br>
    He gets your orders where they need to go, helps with market days, keeps us stocked on ingredients, and makes sure the operation runs steady while Megan bakes nonstop. However he is known to step into the kitchen when it comes to making his farm harvest last through the winter with his canner.<br>
    <br>
    <i> If it comes out of a jar, Dave made it! </i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Farmer Lucas Herrera</h2>
    <br>
    <img width= "200px" height= "200px" style="border-radius: 1rem;" src="/images/meet-the-team/lucas.png" alt="Portrait of Farmer Lucas Herrera"></img>
    <p>
    Lucas helps behind the scenes with planning, problem solving, and keeping the business organized. He jumps in wherever we need a second set of hands or a fresh idea.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Farmer John Black</h2>
    <br>
    <img width= "200px" height= "200px" style="border-radius: 1rem;" src="/images/meet-the-team/john.png" alt="Portrait of Farmer Megan Lund"></img>
    <p>
    John supports the business from the background with structure, systems, and long term thinking. He helps us stay on track and grow at a pace that makes sense.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
    Right now we are small, but we are building something special. Fresh sourdough. Simple ingredients. A little local bakery doing its best for the community around us. <br>
    <br>
    And Soon?<br>
    <br>
    A farm with a cozy farmstore, big craft barn, decked out tinkerer's shop, busy woodlot, lush pastures, learning centre for farm tours and classes and of course a bakery!<br>
    <br>
    For now small steps
    <br?>
    Every loaf gets us closer to our dreams.<br>
